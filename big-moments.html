  <h2>MHSA Soul Step Charity Walk</h2>
  <p>
    MHSA’s Soul Step Charity Walk 2025 marked a milestone at the University
    of Toronto Mississauga as the first mental health charity walk ever hosted
    on campus. This meaningful initiative brought students together to walk in
    support of mental health awareness while fostering community, reflection,
    and collective action.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through the dedication and generosity of participants, the event raised
    <strong>$1,000 in support of CAMH</strong>, contributing to vital mental
    health research, care, and advocacy. Soul Step was more than a walk — it
    was a step forward for mental health at UTM.
