<!-- MISSION -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    The University of Toronto Mississauga Mental Health Student Association
    (UTM MHSA) was founded in 2021 to support and empower UTM students on
    their mental health journeys. We connect students with both on-campus
    and off-campus mental health resources while fostering awareness of
    mental wellness among students and staff alike.
  </p>

  <p>
    At its core, UTM MHSA is about building a supportive community where
    individuals feel encouraged to share their personal experiences with
    mental health and well-being. Like a butterfly spreading its wings, we
    hope to inspire growth, resilience, and transformation in every student
    we reach.

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    We understand that university life can make it challenging to seek help for mental 
    health struggles. That’s why we host interactive events, facilitate engaging
    discussions, and bring attention to the mental health issues most relevant to our
    community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is to continue growing the association into a safe and welcoming space 
    where all UTM students can find support during stressful times—whether it’s 
    midterms, exams, or personal challenges. By fostering these conversations, 
    we aim to break the stigma surrounding mental health and invite all students 
    to join us in making this vision a reality.
